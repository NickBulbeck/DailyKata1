	<h1>Kata</h1>
	<p>Saturday 1st December 2018</p>
	<p>This one is unusual in that it was done from a different laptop. GitHub remote setting worked fine. But this laptop doesn't have my standard css file getting rid of the sans serif fonts, and I couldn't be bothered to make one. Maybe I should.</p>
	<p>OK, I did. Good discipline an' a' tha'.</p>
